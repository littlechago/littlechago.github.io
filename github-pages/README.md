# QR Hunt - GitHub Pages Site for AdSense Approval

This repository contains a complete website for QR Hunt that you can use to get approved for Google AdSense. Once approved, you can implement AdSense in your QR Hunt app.

## Step 1: Set Up GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one at [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. Create a new repository named `yourusername.github.io` (replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username)
3. Upload all the files from this `github-pages` folder to your repository
4. Go to your repository settings > Pages
5. Make sure the source is set to "main" branch
6. Your site will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io`

## Step 2: Apply for Google AdSense

1. Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/)
2. Sign up using your GitHub Pages URL (`https://yourusername.github.io`)
3. Fill out the application form
4. Add the AdSense code snippet to your site (Google will provide this)
   - Add it to the `<head>` section of each HTML file
5. Submit your application
6. Wait for approval (typically 1-2 weeks)

## Step 3: Implement AdSense in QR Hunt

Once approved:

1. Open `ad-landing-simple.html` in your QR Hunt project
2. Replace the placeholder AdSense code with your actual AdSense publisher ID
3. Create an ad unit in your AdSense dashboard
4. Add the ad unit code to the ad container in `ad-landing-simple.html`
5. Test to make sure ads are displaying correctly

## Important Notes

- Keep your GitHub Pages site active and accessible during the AdSense review process
